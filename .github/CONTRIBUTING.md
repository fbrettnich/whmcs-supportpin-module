## Contributing
If you want to contribute, follow these steps:
- [Fork](https://github.com/fbrettnich/whmcs-supportpin-module/fork) this repository
- Make your changes
- Check your changes
- Create a [pull request](https://github.com/fbrettnich/whmcs-supportpin-module/pulls)
<!--    - **Important:** Create pull requests only in our `development` or `feature` branch, pull requests to the `main` branch will be rejected! -->

## Don't forget "Signed-off-by"
It is required that all commit messages include the `Signed-off-by` line with a name and email address that matches the commit author.  
Pull requests that are not signed off according to the [Developer's Certificate of Origin](#developers-certificate-of-origin-11) are automatically rejected.

Commit example:
```GIT
My commit message

Signed-off-by: John Doe <john@doe.org>
```

Git has a `-s` command line option to automatically append this to your commit message:
```GIT
$ git commit -s -m 'My commit message'
```

In the most software there is also a check box in the commit dialog to do this automatically:
